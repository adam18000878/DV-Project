            Increment of death would be cause by the mutation of the virus which using greek alphabet.
            2nd graph which is vaccine type distribution which shows on the type of vaccine and amount of it distributed.
            We can see that Pfizer have the highest distribution among other different vaccine. However for Sinopharm is very low which is 43,803 doses was distributed
            Next, Overall's Death Line Chart which shows amount of deceased over a duration.
